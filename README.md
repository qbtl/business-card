## Usage

This card is set to be kind of my developer ID. You could do the same by forking this repo and then modifiy the infos inside the build.js file as you like.
You'll need to publish it to npm in order for it to work properly. Don't forget to change the informations inside the package.json file to match your name.

## npm

```sh
$ npx qbtl/business-card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
